```sed```-based biomedical sentence chunking (splitting)

* My experiments in processing biomedical text with sed and regex expressions.
* Useful for biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) pre-processing, etc.
* Not by any means perfect, but very good sentence chunking, other capabilities.
  * tests: my script > OpenNLP (v. good) > GeniaSS ...
* Mostly for my own use, but shared in case it's of interest/use to others.
* See my comments in the bash script for additional detail/information.

**USAGE:**
```
      ./sed_sentence_chunker.sh  <input_file>  <output_file>
   bash sed_sentence_chunker.sh  <input_file>  <output_file>
```
