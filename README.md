sed-based biomedical sentence chunking (splitting): experiments in processing biomedical text with sed and regex expressions.

Useful for biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) pre-processing, etc.

Not by any means perfect, but very good sentence chunking, other capabilities.

Mostly for my own use, but shared in case it's of interest/use to others.

See my comments in the bash script for additional information (usage; ...).

USAGE:
```
      ./sed_sentence_chunker.sh  <input_file>  <output_file>
   bash sed_sentence_chunker.sh  <input_file>  <output_file>
```
